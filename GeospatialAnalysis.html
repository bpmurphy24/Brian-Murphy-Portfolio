    <p class="explain"> Geospatial analysis is part of a broader field known as Geographic Informations Systems (GIS). 
    As a student of GIS at Humboldt State University I have learned how to collect and process geospatial data in the form of 
      raster imagery and vector shape files. With this data I can perform geoprocessing and raster analysis to create maps that 
      can be used for practical practical applications by many fields. One emphasis of my studies at HSU is cartography, or the science
      and art of making maps. Cartography is a bridge between my artistic knowledge and my environmental science background.

      <h4>Ocean inundation risk surrounding Humboldt Bay</h4>
      <p> This was a project performed for GSP 270, Geospatial Analysis, with Professor David Gwenzi at Humboldt State University.
      The goal of this project was to asses the extent of flooding in the Humboldt Bay region due to the potential effects
      of human induced climate change. </p>

      <h4>King Fire Burn Severity </h4>
       <p>Analysis of the intensity and extent of the King Fire which burned 97,000 acres of Ed Dorado County, California in 2014.
       To acomplish this analysis, the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) was calculated. These values were then classified to represent the burn severity. 
       This project was performed for GSP 216, Introduction to Remote Sensing, with Professor Sara Hanna.</p>

      <h4>Creating a Map for Elementary Students</h4><p> In order to create an atlas style map with the least amount of distortion, Tissot Ellipses were used
      to determine the types of distortion inherint in each map projection. One projection with the appropriate amount of distortin
      for the maps purpose was the Winkel Triple projection. This project was performed for GSP 316, Cartography, with Professors
      Amy Rock and Nick Perdue.</p>
